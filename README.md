# QAOA_vs_ED
Here we will compare between one well known (ED) and another new method (QAOA) for quantum simulations of many-body physics.

To comapre between them, we will try to solve the problem of transeverse field Ising model (TFIM) in one dimentsion, and the toric code model in two dimension.

**the toric code probelm will be updated later.
