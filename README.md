# QAOA_vs_ED
Here we will compare between one well known ([ED](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_diagonalization)) and another new method ([QAOA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_optimization_algorithms#Quantum_approximate_optimization_algorithm)) for quantum simulations of many-body physics.

To comapre between them, we will try to solve the problem of transeverse field Ising model ([TFIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse-field_Ising_model)) in one dimentsion, and the toric code model in two dimension.

**the [toric code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toric_code) probelm will be updated later.
